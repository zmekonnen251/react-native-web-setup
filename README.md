# react-native-web-setup
This repo is to show a step-by-step guide to initiate a React Native App which can run on Android, iOS and Web. It's using react-native cli and some manual configuration. We'll NOT be using Expo.

This repo is being used in [this article](https://dev.to/shivams136/create-react-native-app-for-android-ios-and-web-without-expo-48lc), which I wrote as a tutorial to setup React Native for Web using `react-native-cli`.

First commit in this repo is the output of `react-native init` and second commit is the same project with web support added.

Feel free to use this repo.
